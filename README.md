## üìÇ Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge in many organizations. Using data-driven techniques, this project explores the key drivers of turnover and builds classification models to predict which employees are likely to leave.

### üí° Objectives:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on employee data
- Identify key features influencing turnover
- Build machine learning models to predict attrition
- Evaluate model performance using ROC-AUC and classification metrics
